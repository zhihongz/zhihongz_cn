%   abbr, desc, abstract, html, pdf, supp, code, poster, slides, blog, project, website, media, arxiv, selected, bibtex_show, preview, awards, altmetric
% Note:
%   abbr          Show as a badge in front of a bib item
%   preview:      Show an image/mp4 video in front of a bib item, valid when site.enable_pub_preview = true in config.yml. 
%                 If site.enable_pub_preview = false or no `preview` keyword, a journal abbr badge will show instead. 
%                 You can set enable_jour_abbr_color=true and assign different color for different journal in _data/venues.yml.
%   desc:         Show a bolded description below journal/conference title, for example {Spotlight Presentation [top 3%]}
%   award:        Show supplementary tag information (like awards) below journal abbr badge, for example {Oral, Spotlight}
%   selected:     Selected to be shown on the `about` page 
%   bibtex_show:  Show a bibtex button for cite information
